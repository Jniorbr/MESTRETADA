# 🧠 MESTRETADA — Introduction to Programming Logic with JavaScript

This repository marks the beginning of my programming journey. Under the guidance of **Professor Eduardo Tadashi**, I developed a series of basic exercises using **JavaScript** to strengthen my understanding of programming logic and computational thinking.

The goal is not to master a specific language or tool, but to build a solid foundation by solving simple problems and writing clean, structured code.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created to:

- Practice fundamental logic and problem-solving
- Understand how to break down problems and implement solutions
- Develop confidence in reading and writing basic JavaScript
- Document my learning process as a beginner

---

## 📁 Project Structure

All code is organized in a single file:

- `index.js`: contains multiple exercises, each defined as a function (`exercise01()`, `exercise02()`, etc.)

At the bottom of the file, a single function call is written to determine which exercise will be executed. You must **manually edit this line** to run the desired exercise.

---

## ▶️ How to Run

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed

### Steps

1. Open the project folder in **Visual Studio Code** (or any code editor)
2. In the terminal, run the file using:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
3. Before running, **edit the last line of `index.js`** and insert the name of the exercise function you want to test, for example:
   ```javascript
   exercise03();
   ```
4. Save the file and re-run the command.

> ⚠️ This program does **not prompt the user** to choose an exercise. You must define which one to execute by editing the code manually.
